# DisposableVehiclesAddon
An open-source addon for the Minecraft plugin Vehicles that allows you to delete vehicles the moment you dismount them.

Original [plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9C%88%EF%B8%8Fvehicles-no-resourcepacks-needed.12446/) is by Pollitoyeye, I did **NOT** make the Vehicles plugin, I only made an addon for it utilizing its API.

Please ensure that the "remove on dismount" in the Vehicles ``config.yml`` is NOT enabled, as it will conflict.
